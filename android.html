                The Android operating system is the largest installed base among various mobile platforms across the
                globe. Hundreds of millions of mobile devices are powered by Android in more than 190 countries of the
                world. It conquered around 75% of the global market share by the end of 2020, and this trend is growing
                bigger every other day. The company named Open Handset Alliance developed Android for the first time
                that is based on the modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software. Google
                sponsored the project at initial stages and in the year 2005, it acquired the whole company. In
                September 2008, the first Android-powered device launched in the market. Android dominates the mobile OS
                industry because of the long list of features it provides. It’s user-friendly, has huge community
                support, provides a greater extent of customization, and a large number of companies build
                Android-compatible smartphones. As a result, the market observes a sharp increase in the demand for
                developing Android mobile applications, and with that companies need smart developers with the right
                skill set. At first, the purpose of Android was thought of as a mobile operating system. However, with
                the advancement of code libraries and its popularity among developers of the divergent domain, Android
                becomes an absolute set of software for all devices like tablets, wearables, set-top boxes, smart TVs,
                notebooks, etc.
